# SIMPLEX
very simple starting point.

I am checking https://medium.com/@muditbits/simplex-method-for-linear-programming-1f88fc981f50  
the "Simplex Algorithm"


# Implementation : would be tested in diff langs
   - Zig
   - Scala (maybe)
   - Go
   - ... 

To optimize : 
$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
